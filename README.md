##LAMP playbook for Ansible.
Green Team : Project Work Ansible for Module 5 - Master BIP

Run:
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

In case you don't have editing permissions as might be the case of Ubuntu virtual machines, one solution is to use sudo in the following way:
```
sudo ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

Then visit 
```
http://localhost/index.php
```

and 
```
http://localhost/db.php
```
